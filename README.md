# CachePDO

CachePDO is a wrapper class for PHP applications to interact with PostgreSQL and MySQL databases. It allows you to interact with any of these DBMS transparently without delving into the differences of PHP interaction with these systems for the developer - work with both DBMS will be the same in terms of programming.

The class supports prepared statements. 
In addition, there is additional functionality to implement the concept of parallel query execution within a single database connection and methods to implement asynchronous query execution.
